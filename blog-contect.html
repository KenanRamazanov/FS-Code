        Instagram posts are still viral and successful. More and more brands are using the Instagram story. Stories on Instagram have proved to be a more personal, interactive, and relatable way to communicate with customers. Here in our blog, we shared the best effective Instagram story ideas.<br><br>

The more static conventional Instagram posts are probably good, but you have the opportunity to "tell your story" with an Instagram story. A compelling message is sent by marketing your brand through stories. Users would like to see who you are. They want some insight into the ideals and past of your brand.<br><br>

The best thing about integrating stories from Instagram into your marketing campaign for your brand is that getting started is super fast. Not to mention, this is your chance to have fun and interact with your potential customers with a few social networks.<br><br>

Instagram stories are the best way to do precisely that, whether you're trying to advertise a new product or service or raise brand recognition in general. The question is, for example, how do you go about selling the new product? What is the perfect way to bring attention to your story and get viewers to watch it?<br><br>

In terms of making an Instagram post, the best way to start is to get a grip on your followers first. You ought to build the kinds of stories that would attract them, after all. How do you captivate the audiences you intend to turn to consumers and entertain them?<br><br>

First of all, you would want to do a little research on social media. Check to see what sort of stuff your followers prefer to share. What stories and blogs have the most significant commitment? It would be an invaluable springboard for your own Instagram story to consider their browsing habits and your followers' patterns regarding how, where, and with what sort of content they connect.<br><br>

When you know what kind of content your customers want to see, you are now able to build your first story for Instagram. Below are suggestions for Instagram stories that can not only help you make a splash on social media but also improve interaction with customers and future followers:<br><br>
    </p>
    <h6>Answer followers’ questions</h6>
    <p>
      This method is one of the best effective Instagram story ideas. Rate dedication by answering questions from your audience that matter to your company. You can inquire about something. A question sticker with the words "ask me anything" is an easy way to start. Your viewers can engage with your Instagram story in this way, and you can show yourself as an expert on the subject.
    </p>
    <img src="img/photo_2021.png" class="img-fluid mt-3">
    <h6 class="my-5">Create polls and quizzes</h6>
    <p>
      Instead of posing an open-ended question, if you want to direct your audience on the response front, consider doing a survey or a quiz. For this, stickers will assist you. 
      Engage the audience with a multiple-choice answer. This enables individuals to connect with your post by clicking a button rather than typing a reply. When posting something worthy of the hype, a sliding reaction is equally easy and efficient. 
    </p>

    <p class="my-5">
      Now, depending on what you'd like to see, Instagram is trying to serve content. If you open your feed, you're likely to see content from users you know and connect heavily with. 
      It's a compelling indication for Instagram to provide a clear contact message with others. It shows them that your contact is the one you're interacting about, not just a random account you used to follow in 2016. Ask people, then, to send you a message. It would be best if you also were sincerely interested in having genuine relationships with your supporters and clients.
